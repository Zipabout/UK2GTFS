gtfs_compress(gtfs)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{a gtfs object}

a gtfs object

\description{
Reduce file size of a GTFS object
}
\details{
by default UK2GTFS tries to preserve id numbers during the conversion
  process to allow back comparisons to the original files, e.g.
  `transxchange2gtfs()` retains stop ids from the NAPTAN. However this means
  files sizes are increased. This function replaces ids with integers and
  thus reduces the size of the gtfs file.
